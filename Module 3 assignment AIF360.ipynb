    "# Module 3 - Algorithm auditing: Accuracy, Fairness and Interpretability \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be asked to evaluate a set of trained classifiers for accuracy, fairness and transparency. The classifiers have been trained on the [NIJ Recidivism Challenge Dataset](https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/recidivism-forecasting-challenge) to predict whether or not an individual will be arrested for a new crime within 3 years after being released on parole. \n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is modeled after “Accuracy, Fairness, and Interpretability of Machine Learning Criminal Recidivism Models, by Eric Ingram, Furkan Gursoy, Ioannis A. Kakadiaris (https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14237). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, it is possible to work in **groups of up to 2 students**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Group members\n",
    "Leave blanks if group has less than 2 members:\n",
    "- Student 1:\n",
    "- Student 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this week's lecture and tutorial work, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Describe different fairness metrics, such as statistical parity, equal opportunity and equal accuracy \n",
    "2. Discuss fairness and fairness metrics from the perspective of multiple stakeholders \n",
    "3. Define objective functions based on fairness metrics  \n",
    "4. Evaluate a model’s transparency using strategies such as global surrogate models, permutation feature importance, and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) \n",
    "5. Evaluate common machine learning models based on their accuracy, fairness and interpretability \n",
    "6. Describe how metrics such as accuracy and fairness need to be balanced for a trained model to have acceptable accuracy and low bias "

    "\n",
    "Before starting this assignment, we ask you to read the paper it has been modeled after, to get an idea of the problem we are working on: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14237\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also review the original dataset source [here](https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/recidivism-forecasting-challenge). The website includes a lot of information on the dataset and a detailed description of each of its columns (look for Appendix 2: Codebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have familiarized with the problem, you know that the goal is predicting the binary variable `Recidivism_Within_3years`, which indicates whether or not the person has committed a new felony or misdemeanour within 3 years from the beginning of parole supervision. \n",
    "\n",
    "The National Institute of Justice’s (NIJ) obviously would want to deploy a highly accurate predictive model, to make sure that only deserving people get released on parole. Unfortunately, the existence of bias in the training set (typically historical or representation bias) makes it very likely to end up with an unfair classifier, that is, a classifier that produces different results for different protected classes of population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to evaluate 4 classifiers, pre-trained and provided to you. This is called **algorithm auditing:** you are not the designer of the model, but you are in charge of evaluating its performance. Algorithm auditing can focus on various metrics and populations of interest, but in this case we will focus on evaluating **accuracy, fairness and transparency** of each algorithm.\n",

The ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve is a plot of the recall and false positive rate of a classifier for different classification thresholds (see [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc) for more details). AUC values go between 0 and 1. Higher values are more desirable as they indicate that the classifier is good at avoiding both false positives and false negatives. A value of 0.5 for a binary classification indicates that the classifier is no better at predicting the outcome than random guessing.\n",

This means it provides a good balance between catching actual recidivists (recall) and not falsely labeling people (precision). In a criminal justice context, having this balance is important because we want to protect public safety without unfairly denying parole to people who won't reoffend. XGBoost outperforms the other models in finding this middle ground.\n",
